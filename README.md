# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
I use API from https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. I usid get and post request and responce and I use fetch, try and catch.
My english is not that good so please don't judge me by my english.

This work is from my maind and i did not copy nor paste or see any other code.
you will see it as i explane every part of this work.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
I add many extrapoints like:

1-I add alert that zip code is empty and this will excute if only zip code left empty.

2-I add extra information like were are this zip code and humidity to make this api more usable such as country and humidity.

3-I convert the C to F inside the function and did not used extranal function. I think this is good way. I did not want the code to be longer

4-toFix to make the 1 decimal we not want to make the temp with alot of decimals

by the way: I'm learning git so you will see alot of commits please ignor them this is the last version.

I hope to aprove my project.

again: I did not copy nor paste any other code and you will know if there is any copied parts.
